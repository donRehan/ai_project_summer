Updates
Now right movement when blocked changes correctly.
I hence just need to clean the output only. Then add the horizontal objects too and we are done.

BUGS
Maybe the actual bug is in clean_array

Fix left first

Test , Should work with moving vertical object,

Next add right and left movement into the project for the horizontal objects.

Revise the code for any mistakes or any parts left not done yet

Then push and text them we are done with the search problem , Shalaby you can call the guy to do this , I will do tomorrow df and iterative deepining.

End => Create a nice graph representation of the problem and of the problem in the readME file.
