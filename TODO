Updates
created move down node , using a clean code approach. Thus far I changed vertical Objects movement down to be of a more DRY approach and it worked.
Now Right movement will also be revised.

BUGS
Maybe the actual bug is in clean_array

Fix left first

Test , Should work with moving vertical object,

Next add right and left movement into the project for the horizontal objects.

Revise the code for any mistakes or any parts left not done yet
